Some Fun Facts About Javascript

1. JavaScript took just 10 days to develop.

JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich for use with the Netscape 2 browser. The original name for JavaScript was Mocha. In my opinion, I’ve gotten a few too many questions from non-programmers confusing JavaScript and Java, so maybe Mocha would have been the right call.

2. JavaScript was probably named after Java.

JavaScript is about as similar to Java as a hamburger is similar to ham. But, there used to be support for running Java in the browser by way of Java “applets”. This technology is now completely deprecated, but at the time, it likely made more sense to piggy-back off the popularity of Java for the sake of widespread adoption.
